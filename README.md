My first attempt using Pyhton, i come from a .NET background favourite language C# 
Also im not familiar with using GIT HUB, I come from a Team Foundation Server background so a bit of a learning curve.

I choose Pycharm EDU Edition as my IDE.
I have run used the following Operating Systems just to see what differs here with developing in Python
Ubuntu 15
Windows 10
Mac OSX 

For the SHA3 Encoding task i used pysha3 0.3
Available here https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pysha3/

I installed it via an executable on windows
I installed it via the terminal on the Linux based OS's

Navigate to downloaded files in terminal
#sudo python setup.py install
3
Then add the pysha3 library as an external reference in PyCharm abnd its ready to use or you can copy the _sha3 folder into you project.
Located : pysha3-0.3\Modules
